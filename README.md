Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This project was to create an AI that can navigate a grid like maze. I was given the framework and environment all set up and the py files to run the program. I personally had to create the algorithm for the Deep Q-learning with the neural network, replay buffer, target network, and the e-greedy policy.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists help design, develop, and improve systems to solve real world problems. It matters because almost every aspect of our modern life relies on technology and it is constantly evolving as our needs change,

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As an aspiring computer scientist, I first start a problem by breaking the problem into smaller parts so I can separate them into more manageable segments. This then involves making sure I understand the problem correctly, so I start to plan how to solve it. Usually, it has trial and error and revisions.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

To the end users and organizations, I have an ethical responsibility to create software and solutions that are safe and dependable. This also includes protecting user data and maintaining transparency about the data collected and how it is used. I need to think about how my software will affect the users and not just the functionality of it.
